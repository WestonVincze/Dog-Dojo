# DogDojo
An ASP.net core MVC application for buying dogs.

This project was created for learning purposes. When I started this project I already had years of experience with ASP.NET, but I hadn't built many projects from scratch. I decided to challenge myself and create a mock e-commerce website. On top of designing and developing the project, I also created a custom animated logo and color scheme. I love dogs, so I thought it would be fun to create a page in a world where you could buy dogs online as one might buy clothing online. Perhaps this concept could be re-used in practise for a dog shelter website to showcase the available dogs.
